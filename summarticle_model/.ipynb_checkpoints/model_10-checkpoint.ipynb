    "# [{'summary_text': 'This paper discusses several different algorithmic models to predict software development time and other management parameters. The most commonly used is the Putnam model, but it is not reliable in all cases. In this paper, the authors propose a new model that predicts much more accurately than the putnam model. The authors examine several different statistical methods to predict real-time performance of this model. They also discuss several different types of prediction such as the \"routine\" or \"learning curve,\" which are used to predict future performance of a particular task. They conclude that this model can be useful for predicting future performance on a broad range of industrial applications as well as specific ones.'}]"
